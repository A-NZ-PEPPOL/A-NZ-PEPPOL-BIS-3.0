## **Specification release process**

**Peppol Business Interoperability Specifications (BIS)**

–	Peppol standards for business processes and transactions are updated biannually in May and November.

–	Releases typically contain minor corrections and/or enhancements proposed by Peppol members (service providers or Peppol Authorities).

–	The specifications provide message syntax, business rules, code lists and implementation guidance, and are supported by centrally-maintained validation artefacts to assist service providers to implement services that comply with the standards.

**A-NZ e-invoicing**
–	The A-NZ e-invoice and self-billing specifications are substantially the same as Peppol BIS Billing with minor differences e.g. to accommodate GST rather than VAT .
–	With each Peppol release, changes to BIS Billing are reflected in the A-NZ specifications which are generally published approximately two weeks after the Peppol BIS release.
–	In the rare event of potentially significant changes being to BIS Billing made at short notice, the changes may be reflected in the A-NZ extension in the following biannual release.

**Peppol e-procurement**
–	While BIS Billing is constrained to comply with European standards (EN16931), including using the term ‘VAT’ in the definition of a number of terms and business rules, no such constraint exists for the other e-procurement documents.
–	Peppol eProcurement specifications were updated in May 2020 to support non-VAT tax schemes including GST, and that allowed A-NZ providers to implement Peppol e-procurement documents ‘as-is’ without localisation.
–	Therefore the normal Peppol release processes apply to those documents without the need to subsequently issue localised specifications.
